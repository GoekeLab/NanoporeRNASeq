# NanoporeRNASeq
The *NanoporeRNASeq* package contains long read RNA-Seq data generated using Oxford Nanopore Sequencing. The data consists of 6 samples from two human cell lines (K562 and MCF7) that were generated by the [SG-NEx project](https://github.com/GoekeLab/sg-nex-data). Each of these cell lines has three replicates, with 1 direct RNA sequencing data and 2 cDNA sequencing data. Reads are aligned to chromosome 22  (Grch38) and stored as bam files. The original data is from the SG-NEx project. Please see the package vignette for examples and use cases.
